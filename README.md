## Hugo x Tailwind Starter Code

This is my personal starter code for Hugo x TailwindCSS.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

**Get the theme**

- Run from the root of your Hugo site:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/antheiz/hugo-tailwind-starter.git themes/karokari
    ```

- Alternatively, you can include this repository as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitsubmodules). This makes it easier to update this theme if you have your Hugo site in git as well:

    ```sh
    git submodule add https://github.com/antheiz/hugo-tailwind-starter.git themes/karokari
    ```
    
**Configuring theme to your project**

1. Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to the root folder of your the website
2. Run `npm install` to install required packages for theme
3. Set `theme = 'karokari'` in config.toml
4. Run `hugo server` to start your local server
